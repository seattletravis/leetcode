Welcome to my leetcode diary. While learning to code and to solve fundamental data structure and algorythms, I decided to keep my leetcode here as a Journal to this Journey.
I have also recorded some youtube videos on some of the more intersting code.

To use this repository simply navigate to the filefolder that contains the problem.txt file and the leet.py file. Put them both in your editor and take a look. Happy Hacking!

Ready.
